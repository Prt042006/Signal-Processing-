This project focuses on developing an intelligent traffic light system using image processing. A camera captures real-time images of traffic signals, which are processed to detect the traffic signal pole within a defined region of interest (ROI). Based on accurate detection and filtering techniques, the system aims to recognize traffic signal status and improve decision-making for traffic control.The project is designed for controlled environments and will later be tested in real-world field conditions to evaluate performance and reliability.
